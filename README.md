# SES Live Search

This project was allocated by Jim Catelli from the Communications Support Unit of the State Emergency Services of WA, to UWA students completing the unit CITS3200 Professional Computing.

This project has two main goals:
1. To create a physical system between two LoRa devices running the Meshtastic protocol, in which one device constantly transmits GPS locations (amongst other data) to the other device, which is connected via a headless computer to a cloud that can upload these GPS locations.
2. To provide a web-based interface for visualizing GPS data collected from these base stations. Users from the CSU should be able to view and filter searches, visualise historical GPS data on an interactive map, and download GPX files for further analysis.

## Installation

Because of the complex nature of this project, the entire setup process cannot be described here.

Instead, please refer to the `Documentation` folder located in this repository for instructions on how to setup the devices, the web application, and the Microsoft Azure peripheral infrastructure.
